Welcome to JHipster-UML!

This project's main goal is to bring support of UML (more precisely, XMI) files (from various editors) to JHipster so that it can read the files, without you answering the questions.

You'll be able to create your entities by supplying a UML file (made with your favorite editor, if it supports XMI) to JHipster, and we'll take care of creating your entities for you!

The currently supported editors are: Modelio (we recommend this one!), UMLDesigner (and Papyrus for Eclipse), GenMyModel, Visual Paradigm and StarUML.

Stay tuned for more news about this project.
